 http server in nodejs

 one machine can run multiple servers and to differentiate between each server we use port number
 
 if port number is less than 1024  (2^10) are used by OS need admin priveledge  (sudo)

if no port number (only domain)   --> defualt port number is 80  -->  INtranet  --> only people connected to same network can access to this localhost

80  --> http 


static IP --> dedicated IP given (will be same always)

NATTING   & port forwarding
Network Address Translation
        --> how to access private IP (192 series)
        --> we need to access router IP (gateway IP) 
          --> route or  network settings
        ---> vishika's router will talk to zoheb's router
        ---> do router configuration and login to router
        --> then access to zoheb's IP
        --> that's why we need aws 


NAT  

voice over IP (voip) server


The Secure Shell (SSH) protocol  --> a method for securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network

    --> remotely talk to machine
    --> by defulat encrypted
    --> 22 port number


router not only runs web protocols
